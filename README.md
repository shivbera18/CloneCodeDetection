The provided script builds and trains a Siamese network with a bidirectional LSTM backbone to perform code clone detection. It includes tokenization, data preparation, dataset creation, and evaluation with relevant metrics. Below are some key highlights and possible improvements:

Highlights:
Dataset: Uses the "BigCloneBench" dataset from Hugging Face's datasets library, which is a well-known dataset for clone detection tasks.
Preprocessing: Includes tokenization and padding for fixed-length sequence input to the model.
Model Architecture:
An embedding layer converts tokens into dense vectors.
A bidirectional LSTM captures sequential context from both directions.
Fully connected layers process the LSTM's output to generate feature embeddings.
Cosine similarity measures the relationship between the two embeddings.
Loss Function: Uses contrastive loss, which encourages embeddings of similar pairs to be close and dissimilar pairs to be far apart.
Metrics: Evaluates the model using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
Suggestions for Improvements:
Batch Limit:
The batch_limit in the training loop may prematurely stop the epoch. Consider either removing it or making it optional for debugging.
Handling Class Imbalance:
Code clone datasets often have imbalanced classes. If imbalance exists, use techniques like class weights in the loss or oversampling during training.
Inference Threshold:
The similarity threshold (0.5) might not be optimal. It can be fine-tuned based on the validation set for better precision-recall balance.
Logging:
Use a logging library (like wandb or tensorboard) to monitor metrics across epochs for better visualization.
Testing:
Split a separate validation set from the training data to fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, sequence length, and threshold.
Optimization:
Experiment with different optimizers or learning rates.
Try a cyclic learning rate scheduler or other adaptive methods for dynamic training.
Additional Enhancements:
Regularization: Consider L2 regularization or increase dropout rates if overfitting occurs.
Data Augmentation: Introduce techniques like variable-length padding or perturbing code with synonymous tokens.
Model Improvements:
Use pre-trained embeddings such as CodeBERT or GPT embeddings for code tokens to leverage prior knowledge.
Explore transformer-based architectures for better performance.
Potential Issues:
Memory Limitations: Ensure sufficient memory for embedding layers and padded sequences.
Padding Effects: Shorter sequences padded to the max length might affect model training. Consider masking padded tokens during embedding or LSTM computation.

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9 or newer
- Additional Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivbera18/CloneCodeDetection.git
   cd CloneCodeDetection
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Verify installation by running:

python --version
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
Dataset
The BigCloneBench dataset is used for training and testing. It is a large benchmark dataset for detecting functionally similar code snippets.

Dataset Details:
Source: BigCloneBench on Hugging Face
Classes: Binary labels (1 for similar code pairs, 0 for dissimilar).
Preprocessing:
Tokenized code snippets using Keras' Tokenizer.
Padded sequences to ensure uniform input length.


Model Architecture:

The Siamese network consists of two identical sub-networks for feature extraction. Key components:

1.Embedding Layer:
Maps tokenized code into dense vector representations.
Embedding size: 128.

2.Bidirectional LSTM:
Captures contextual relationships in code from both directions.
Hidden size: 128.
Two layers with dropout for regularization.

3.Fully Connected Layers:
Reduces feature dimensionality.
Includes Batch Normalization and Dropout.

4.Cosine Similarity:
Measures the similarity between embeddings of code snippets.

5.Contrastive Loss:
Encourages similar pairs to have high cosine similarity and dissimilar pairs to have low similarity.

Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
Testing
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
 Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) in the respective scripts (train.py, evaluate.py).
